## Quick Start

The simplest way to get started:

```bash
# Option 1: Use docker-compose (recommended)
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencewood/clubs/main/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d

# Option 2: Run standalone
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v ./config:/config \
  -e CADDYFILE_PATH=/config/Caddyfile \
  spencewood/clubs:latest

# Access Clubs at http://localhost:8080
```

This starts both Caddy and Clubs with a shared `./config/Caddyfile`.

---

## Deployment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Setup (Clubs + Caddy)

**Use case:** You want to run both Caddy and Clubs together from scratch.

**Setup:**

The included `docker-compose.yml` does this out of the box:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  caddy:
    image: caddy:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      - "2019:2019"   # Admin API
    volumes:
      - ./config:/etc/caddy
      - caddy_data:/data
    environment:
      - CADDY_ADMIN=0.0.0.0:2019

  clubs:
    image: spencewood/clubs:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    environment:
      - CADDYFILE_PATH=/config/Caddyfile
      - CADDY_API_URL=http://caddy:2019
```

**Usage:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- **Caddy:** Serves your sites (ports 80/443)
- **Clubs:** Web editor (port 8080)
- **Live Mode:** Enabled - changes apply instantly via Admin API

---

### Scenario 2: Add to Existing Caddy

**Use case:** You already have Caddy running and want to add Clubs to manage it.

#### Option A: Same Docker Compose

Add Clubs to your existing `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  # Your existing Caddy service
  caddy:
    image: caddy:latest
    # ... your existing config ...
    environment:
      - CADDY_ADMIN=0.0.0.0:2019  # Add this if not present
    networks:
      - your_network

  # Add Clubs
  clubs:
    image: spencewood/clubs:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      # Point to wherever your Caddyfile lives
      - /path/to/your/caddy/config:/config
    environment:
      - CADDYFILE_PATH=/config/Caddyfile
      - CADDY_API_URL=http://caddy:2019
    networks:
      - your_network  # Same network as Caddy
```

**Important:**
- Use the **same network** so Clubs can reach Caddy's Admin API
- Mount the **same config directory** that Caddy uses
- Ensure Caddy's Admin API is enabled and accessible

#### Option B: Separate Docker Compose

If Caddy is in a different compose file or running externally:

```yaml
# clubs-docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  clubs:
    image: spencewood/clubs:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/existing/caddy/config:/config
    environment:
      - CADDYFILE_PATH=/config/Caddyfile
      - CADDY_API_URL=http://your-caddy-host:2019
    networks:
      - existing_caddy_network  # Join Caddy's network

networks:
  existing_caddy_network:
    external: true
```

Start with:

```bash
docker-compose -f clubs-docker-compose.yml up -d
```

---

### Scenario 3: Standalone (File Mode Only)

**Use case:** You want to edit Caddyfiles without connecting to a running Caddy instance.

This is useful for:
- Preparing configurations before deployment
- Editing Caddyfiles that you'll manually copy to servers
- Development/testing

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  clubs:
    image: spencewood/clubs:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    environment:
      - CADDYFILE_PATH=/config/Caddyfile
      # No CADDY_API_URL - runs in File Mode only
```

**Limitations:**
- No "Apply to Caddy" button (File Mode only)
- Changes require manual Caddy restart/reload
- No live validation against Caddy

---

### Scenario 4: Custom Caddy Build (Cloudflare DNS, etc.)

**Use case:** You need a custom Caddy build with specific modules (DNS providers, etc.)

#### Option 1: Use Custom Caddy Image

Replace the Caddy image in docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    # Use a custom build with Cloudflare DNS
    image: caddy:latest-builder
    build:
      context: ./caddy-custom
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    # ... rest of config ...
```

Example custom Caddy Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# caddy-custom/Dockerfile
FROM caddy:builder AS builder

RUN xcaddy build \
    --with github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare

FROM caddy:latest

COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/caddy /usr/bin/caddy
```

#### Option 2: Use Pre-built Custom Image

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/caddy-cloudflare:latest
    # ... rest of config ...
```

**Note:** Clubs works with any Caddy build as long as the Admin API is enabled.

---

### Scenario 5: Production Deployment with Internal Networking

**Use case:** Production deployment where you want Clubs and Caddy Admin API to be internal-only, with access to Clubs UI through Caddy reverse proxy.

This setup follows security best practices by:
- Keeping the Caddy Admin API internal (not exposed to host)
- Keeping Clubs API internal (not exposed to host)
- Exposing Clubs UI only through Caddy reverse proxy
- Allowing zero-downtime updates via internal Docker networking

**Setup:**

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.caddy
    container_name: caddy
    mem_limit: 256m
    mem_reservation: 128m
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/Chicago
      - CADDY_ADMIN=0.0.0.0:2019  # Enable Admin API on all interfaces
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./data:/data
      - /opt/stacks/certificates:/data/caddy/certificates
      - ./config/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
      # 2019 (Admin API) is internal only - not exposed to host
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - clubs-network

  clubs:
    image: spencewood/clubs:latest
    container_name: clubs
    mem_limit: 512m
    mem_reservation: 256m
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - API_PORT=8080
      - CADDYFILE_PATH=/config/Caddyfile
      - CADDY_API_URL=http://caddy:2019  # Internal Docker network address
      - TZ=America/Chicago
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config  # Shared with Caddy for Caddyfile access
    # No ports exposed - accessed via Caddy reverse proxy
    depends_on:
      - caddy
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - clubs-network

networks:
  clubs-network:
    driver: bridge
```

**Add to your Caddyfile** to expose Clubs UI:

```caddy
clubs.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy clubs:80

    # Optional: Add authentication
    basicauth {
        admin $2a$14$hashed_password
    }
}
```

**Security benefits:**
- Port 2019 (Caddy Admin API) is never exposed to the host machine
- Port 80 (Clubs UI) is only accessible via Caddy reverse proxy
- All communication between Clubs and Caddy happens over internal Docker network
- Only HTTPS traffic from Caddy reaches the outside world
- You can add authentication/authorization at the Caddy level

**Custom Caddy Build Example:**

If you need a custom Caddy build (e.g., with Cloudflare DNS module):

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile.caddy
FROM caddy:builder AS builder

RUN xcaddy build \
    --with github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare

FROM caddy:latest

COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/caddy /usr/bin/caddy
```

**Usage:**

```bash
# Start everything
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Access Clubs through Caddy reverse proxy
# Navigate to https://clubs.yourdomain.com
```

**How it works:**
1. Clubs connects to Caddy's Admin API via `http://caddy:2019` (internal Docker network)
2. When you click "Apply to Caddy", changes are sent through the Admin API
3. Caddy applies configuration with zero downtime
4. Users access Clubs UI via Caddy reverse proxy on port 443 (HTTPS)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Clubs Container

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CADDYFILE_PATH` | `./config/Caddyfile` | Path to the Caddyfile to edit |
| `CADDY_API_URL` | `http://localhost:2019` | Caddy Admin API URL |
| `API_PORT` | `3000` | Port for Clubs backend API (container serves on port 80) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | Set to `production` in Docker |

#### Caddy Container

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CADDY_ADMIN` | `localhost:2019` | Admin API listen address. Use `0.0.0.0:2019` to allow Clubs access |

### Volume Mounts

The key to Clubs working is **sharing the same Caddyfile** between Caddy and Clubs:

```yaml
# Caddy mounts config to /etc/caddy
caddy:
  volumes:
    - ./config:/etc/caddy

# Clubs mounts the SAME directory to /config
clubs:
  volumes:
    - ./config:/config
  environment:
    - CADDYFILE_PATH=/config/Caddyfile
```

**Important:** Both containers must see the same file. Use the same host directory.

---

## Live Mode vs File Mode

### Live Mode (Recommended)

**When it works:**
- Clubs can reach Caddy's Admin API
- `CADDY_API_URL` is set correctly
- Caddy Admin API is enabled (`CADDY_ADMIN=0.0.0.0:2019`)

**Features:**
- "Apply to Caddy" button reloads config instantly
- See Caddy API status indicator
- No manual restart needed

**Status indicator:**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Live Mode** - Connected to Caddy Admin API

### File Mode

**When it happens:**
- Caddy Admin API is not reachable
- `CADDY_API_URL` is not set or incorrect
- Running Clubs standalone

**Features:**
- Edit and save Caddyfiles
- Changes written to disk
- Manual Caddy reload required: `docker-compose restart caddy`

**Status indicator:**
- âš« **File Mode** - Editing files only

---

## Troubleshooting

### Clubs shows "File Mode" but Caddy is running

**Problem:** Clubs can't reach Caddy Admin API

**Solutions:**
1. Check they're on the same Docker network
2. Verify `CADDY_API_URL=http://caddy:2019` (use container name, not localhost)
3. Ensure Caddy has `CADDY_ADMIN=0.0.0.0:2019` set
4. Check Caddy logs: `docker-compose logs caddy`

### Changes don't appear in Caddy

**Problem:** Caddy and Clubs aren't sharing the same file

**Solutions:**
1. Verify volume mounts point to same host directory
2. Check `CADDYFILE_PATH` matches where Caddy reads from
3. Restart both: `docker-compose restart`

### "Apply to Caddy" fails

**Problem:** Caddy rejected the configuration

**Solutions:**
1. Check the error message - Caddy will say what's wrong
2. Verify Caddyfile syntax in "Raw" tab
3. Check Caddy logs: `docker-compose logs caddy`

---

## Security Considerations

### Admin API Access

The Caddy Admin API is **powerful** - it can reload configs, view certificates, etc.

**For local development:**
```yaml
CADDY_ADMIN=0.0.0.0:2019  # OK for localhost
```

**For production:**

1. **Don't expose port 2019 externally**:
```yaml
# Remove this from Caddy service:
ports:
  - "2019:2019"  # DON'T expose externally
```

2. **Use Docker networks** - let Clubs reach Caddy internally only

3. **Protect Clubs UI** - add authentication in your Caddyfile:
```caddy
clubs.example.com {
    reverse_proxy clubs:80
    basicauth {
        admin $2a$14$hashed_password
    }
}
```

### File Permissions

Ensure both Caddy and Clubs can read/write the Caddyfile:

```bash
chmod 644 ./config/Caddyfile
```

---

## Certificate Management

Clubs includes a certificate viewer that displays SSL/TLS certificates managed by Caddy, including:
- Let's Encrypt ACME certificates
- ZeroSSL certificates
- Custom SSL certificates
- Internal PKI certificates

### Viewing Certificates

Clubs reads SSL/TLS certificates from **Caddy's certificate storage directory**. You need to mount the `caddy_data` volume (read-only is recommended):

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    image: caddy:latest
    volumes:
      - ./config:/etc/caddy
      - caddy_data:/data  # Caddy's data volume

  clubs:
    image: spencewood/clubs:latest
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - caddy_data:/data/caddy:ro  # Mount read-only to view certificates
    environment:
      - CADDYFILE_PATH=/config/Caddyfile
      - CADDY_API_URL=http://caddy:2019
      - CADDY_CERTIFICATES_PATH=/data/caddy/certificates  # Default path

volumes:
  caddy_data:  # Shared volume for certificate storage
```

**Important:** The certificates on disk are the actual certificates Caddy is using. These files are updated by Caddy during the ACME renewal process.

### What You'll See

The Certificates tab displays:
- **SSL Certificates** - Certificates from Caddy's certificate storage:
  - Domain name and Subject Alternative Names (SANs)
  - Issuer (e.g., "Let's Encrypt", "ZeroSSL")
  - Expiration date and days until renewal
  - Serial number and fingerprint
  - Expiration warnings (red for expired, yellow for expiring soon)
  - Certificate file paths
- **Internal PKI** - Caddy's built-in certificate authority (via Admin API)

### How Certificate Reading Works

1. **Production: Filesystem Scan** - Reads certificates from `/data/caddy/certificates` directory
2. **Development: Mock Data** - Shows example certificates when directory is not mounted

The certificate expiration dates help you monitor when Caddy's automatic renewal should occur (typically 30 days before expiry).
